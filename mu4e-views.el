;;; Commentary:

;; `mu4e' is great, but viewing of html emails is suboptimal.  This packages
;; enables the user to choose how to view emails.  It's main use case is to view
;; emails using an xwidgets window, but the user provided viewing methods are
;; also supported.
;;
;; Also provides methods for user defined viewing methods to access content
;; extracted from an email, e.g., urls or attachments.  This makes it easier to
;; build new views.


;;; Code:
;;TODO also wrap mu4e text email viewing to get the customizable behaviour and reduction of window messing

  "A list of commands for viewing messages in mu4e.

Currently supported are:

- \"text\" - the standard `mu4e' text email view
- \"html\" - view email as html in xwidgets
- \"pdf\" - view email as pdf with `mu4e-views-html-to-pdf-command'
- \"browser\" - view email as html in browser using `browse-url'
- \"gnus\" - use mu4e's build-in gnus article view
- \"dispatcher\" - dynamically chooses method per email

A viewing command ic a cons of a string (the methods name as
shown to the user), and a plist the defines the methods
behavior. The following keys are supported:

`:viewfunc' - this is function that does the actual work of
displaying a message. The signature is `(html msg
win)' (or `(msg)' if `:view-function-only-msg' is t) where `html'
is the name of a file storing the message as html, `msg' is a
mu4e message plist (see relevant `mu4e' code, and `win' is a
window in which the message should be displayed in.
`:view-function-only-msg' - if t, then the view function does
only take a single argument `msg' which is a mu4e message
plist. In this case `mu4e-views' will not write the message to an
html file.  `:create-view-window-function' - if called, this
function should create the mu4e message viewing window.
`:is-view-window-p' - if it is currently shown return the viewing
window, otherwise return nil.  `:no-view-window' - if t, then the
viewing method does not use a separate viewing window, e.g., it
may be using an external program like a browser to show the
method. In this case also `:is-view-window-p' does not have to be
provided.  Property `:filter-html' can be used to force
applying (non-nil) or force not-applying (nil) of filtering of
external content from emails.

The dispatcher method is special in that it dynamically chooes
the view method to apply per email, selecting the first view
method whose predicate in
`mu4e-views-dispatcher-predicate-view-map' evaluates to non-nil
if provided the `mu4e' email message as input."
